## Title: How AR and VR Are About to Transform the Tourism Industry.



## Research Question: What is AR and VR technology, how could it be used, and will it change the way you look at the world, today and tomorrow?



## Introduction

The tourism industry is evolving and new technology is emerging everyday. From virtual reality to augmented reality, I want to explore why AR and VR will be such a significant boost for the tourism industry. Focusing on how this technology can enhance the way customers perceive their surroundings, why that's important and what the benefits and risks are for the consumer and the industry itself.

## Section 1: VR? AR? I’m Confused!
 
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have seen rapid growth within the last couple of years but what exactly are they? Put simply, VR is a 3D emulated environment which can be explored and interacted with using what’s called a VR Headset, an example might be watching a live sports event at home but in full 360° VR. AR uses the real-world environment to overlay virtual objects such as text or an image on top, an example would be Pokémon GO a mobile game which allows users to find and capture Pokémon in the real world using their phone.

This technology has seen significant growth in one particular industry, tourism. Why is this? According to study conducted by Adobe Digital Insights (ADI), customers are actively seeking new and exciting experiences like AR and VR. The article supports this by mentioning that social media search terms for travel and AR/VR related experiences has risen year by year suggesting that there is a growing interest in this technology.

## Section 2: Today and Tomorrow, a Look Into the Future.

What does VR and AR offer when compared to the vanilla travel experience? How does this technology benefit the consumer? Companies like Thomas Cook are already offering VR/AR experiences, allowing customers a glimpse of their destination, hotel or cruise. Holidays are expensive, this offers the customer a more immersive and personal look at what they’re buying and for Thomas Cook it encourages the customer to book with them. This is usually referred to as the "try before you buy" method.

Companies are already enhancing the travel system by making the entire process of booking a holiday more convenient. Hotels are offering 360° videos and photos to let customers see their room before they book. Museums are using technology to make exhibits come to life. The Museum of Natural History is using AR, allowing visitors to use an app called "Skin and Bones" to see what an animal would have looked like while alive. This suggests that VR and AR are already impacting the tourism industry providing exciting and immersive new experiences as a key selling point.

Looking towards the future of VR/AR and how fast this technology is evolving, how will it continue to evolve and what impact will this have? VR and AR are predicted to affect every industry out there. This is supported by a study by CCSInsight which reports that the VR/AR device market is expected to hit $1.8 Billion in 2018 and it's estimated that it will increase by 50% annually over the next five years. This is one key component for why companies such as Facebook, Google and Samsung are aiming to make VR/AR mainstream. If we examine the original Oculus Rift which retailed for $599, Oculus have recently released the Oculus GO a smaller model which retails for a more consumer friendly price of $200. It's clear to see that as the market grows, the devices themselves will gradually get cheaper, smaller and more powerful.

## Section 3: The Trouble With New Technology

As with all new technology there are hurdles that must be overcome for new technology to see mass adoption by the average consumer. What are some of these obstacles facing the VR/AR Industry? A survey by Perkins Coie LLP provides some insight. The main concern identified was the user experience, surveyed as the top obstacle for consumers embracing the technology including both VR with 41% and AR with 39%. Additional concerns included the technical limitations of the current hardware and the bulkiness of the headset itself.

When examining our own market today I think a lot of issues will be for the consumer, will there be a premium price? different tiers? might certain features be locked behind a paywall? Looking back at the study by Perkins Coie LLP they found that 59% of companies that took part in the survey plan to monetize AR/VR technology by selling products or subscriptions, while 27% said they would charge for additional features or for in-app purchases. This shows that the VR/AR market will potentially emulate the app market of today.

### Conclusion

There is no doubt in my mind that VR and AR will change the tourism industry forever. The evidence referenced suggests that the market value of VR and AR is going to rise over the next couple of years and studies such as the Adobe Digital Insights article shows that more consumers year by year are actively searching for VR and AR related experiences. 

The travel market is beginning to adopt VR and AR technology already. Thomas Cook are heavily invested in offering immersive VR experiences, while tourist attractions are creating AR apps for a more interactive experience. As the market rises in value so will the technology continue to evolve, with tech companies releasing new hardware year by year that is smaller, cheaper and more powerful.

However, while the technology is improving in a positive way I think consumers have a right to be concerned as well. We can see that there are a lot of negative aspects in today’s market and the research suggests that the VR/AR market will follow a similar model.

Overall, the research shows that the Tourism Industry sees the potential of AR and VR but that we are still in the early phase and companies are still experimenting with what works and doesn't work for their brand. VR and AR will see the most significant boost within the next couple of years and evidence suggests that this is a fantastic opportunity for companies and individuals to invest in this technology while it's still in its early stages.
